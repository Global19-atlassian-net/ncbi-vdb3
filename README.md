## NCBI VDB-3
NCBI's VDB is a highly compressed column-oriented data warehousing technology developed initially to address the needs of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). It is unique in that it builds databases from smaller parts that can function independently as _documents_, supports effective and efficient compression, supports encryption while remaining encrypted on disk, transparent distribution and remote access.
