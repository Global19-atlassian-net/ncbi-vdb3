### Change Log
Please check the CHANGES.md file for change history.

## NCBI VDB-3
NCBI's VDB is a highly compressed column-oriented data warehousing technology developed initially to address the needs of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). It is unique in that it builds databases from smaller parts that can function independently as _documents_, supports effective and efficient compression, supports encryption while remaining encrypted on disk, transparent distribution and remote access.

### Status:
This repository will contain a new set of tools and SDKs for managing VDB databases. The repository is currently only useful to the development team, but will become available to the public with our first release.
